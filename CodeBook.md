## Introduction

The dataset produced by run_analysis.R (results.R) is a data frame containing the means of all mean and standard deviation measurements made by accelerometers and gyrometers in personal fitness tracking equipment.

## Results .txt observations

Each row represents a set of measurements for a given activity level and a given subject.

There are 6 different activity levels, and they are represented in column 1 ("activity").

There are 30 different subjects, and they are represented in column 2 ("subject_id").

The subject and activity level combinations (e.g., "WALKING" + 6) in each row are unique, and therefore represent a unique observation.

Each observation has 66 measurements, contained in columns 3:68.
